## Description

This is a calculator that utilizes a planet's solar years in order to determine a person's age on that planet.  For instance, Earth has a ratio of 365 days to 1 solar year, while mercury has a ratio of 88 days to 1 solar year.  This application takes a person's age and returns it as Earth years, Mercurial years, Venusian years, Martian years, and Jupiterian years.

There is also a relational birthday function - For Example, if a person is 56 Earth years old and we wanted to find out how many years would pass until the person was 61 years old, it would return the following results: 5 Earth years, 20.83 Mercurial years, 20.96 Venusian years, 2.65 Martian years, and 0.42 Jupiterian years.  Conversely, if we wanted to find out how many years had passed since that 56 Earth year old's 43rd birthday, it would return the following: 13 Earth years, 54.16 Mercurial years, 8.06 Venusian years, 6.91 Martian years, and 1.09 Jupiterian years.
